This repository contains the website and documentation for
[Empirica](https://github.com/empiricaly/meteor-empirica-core). It is hosted at
https://empirica.ly. The website source is on the `source` branch, and the
generated/deployed website is on master (because that's what Github Pages wants
to host the website).

We are very thankful for contributions to our documentation, even if just fixing
typos. We do require that you follow the _standard_ Github process with fork +
pull request. If you are not familiar with it, check out
[this short guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

## Note 10/2020

Docs have move to https://docs.empirica.ly/ using GitBook. Docs in this repo are

# Getting Started

When you make changes locally, you will want to test them before pushing them
with a pull request. In this section, we will install the necessary components
to run a local version of the website.

Youâ€™ll need to have Node.js >= 8 on your local development machine. If you don't
already have Node.js 8+ setup, we recommend you use the official installer:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

1. Make sure all the dependencies for the website are installed:

```sh
# The code building the website is all in the website dir
$ cd website
# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

2. Run your dev server:

```sh
# Start the site
$ npm run start
```

This should open a new browser window with the app, you're ready to edit.

## Directory Structure

The file structure should look something like this

```
