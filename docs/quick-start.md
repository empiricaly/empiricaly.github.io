You will first need to install Node.js and Meteor on your local development
machine.

For Node.js, head over to https://nodejs.org/en/ and Download the LTS (left)
bundle, and install it on your machine.

For meteor you can follow the instructions at https://www.meteor.com/install.

Once those are all installed, run the following 3 commands in your terminal.
feel free to change `my-experiment` with the name of you experiment (no spaces).

```sh
npx create-empirica-app my-experiment
cd my-experiment
meteor
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your experiment.

Try and edit files in this folder to change your experiment.

Have fun!
